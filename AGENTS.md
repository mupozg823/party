## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

This repository ("party") is currently a blank/skeleton project initialized with only a `README.md`. There are no source files, dependencies, build systems, services, or tests at this time.

### Current state

- **No language/framework**: No `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, or equivalent.
- **No services**: No backend, frontend, database, or other services are defined.
- **No build/test/lint**: No build scripts, test frameworks, or linters are configured.
- **No Docker**: No `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml`.

### When code is added

Once the first real code and dependency manifest are committed, the update script and this file should be revised to reflect actual setup requirements (dependency installation, environment variables, service startup caveats, etc.).
